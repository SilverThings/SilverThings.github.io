Portable IoT Platform
-----------------

Silverspoon.io aims to provide users with an easy-to-use, though enterprise-ready, IoT platform. Its basic building block is Apache Camel with our custom Camel GPIO Component, allowing users to integrate capabilities of embedded devices with external IT systems, support event-based decision making, or to deploy user applications to IoT gateways as microservices.
